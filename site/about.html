                oiflshdgfanjl; what od ij put heer????
                <br>
                im just a guuuuy just a duuuuude just a brooooo
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>what do??</h3>
                i spend most of my time locked in the basement feeding off of the moss growing on the walls.
                <br>
                since the only thing in here is my epic setup then when i'm not gorging on my basement plants
                i'm usually ignoring all of the perfectly good games in my steam library and<br>
                instead playing the same 10 different games i've been playing for several years.
                <br>
                when im not wasting money buying steam games i'll never play i'm probably watching youtube or smth.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>nerd stuff</h3>
                half of my youtube recommended section is about computer science and game dev stuff and thats about it because i keep forgetting i have visual studio and unity installed and like i do want to start programming more but like also i could just start <i>one more</i> risk of rain run or i can finish that minecraft build ive been meaning to get around to i swear itll take ten minutes i promise and just ughghgjhghg unity take so looooong to opeeeeen and i could watch that brackeys godot tutorial ive been meaning to get around to watching but like i could also i could add an unnesseccary amount of hours onto celeste you feel me?
                <br>
                <br>
                anyway
                <br>
                <br>
                probably my first real experience with anything computer science related was with roblox studio in 6th grade when i tried making games and then realized i didnt have enough brain matter to understand programming yet and gave up for like 3 years and took a game dev class and <b><i>got the highest score anybody in that class had ever gotten on unity certification???</i></b>
                <br>
                i BARELY studied for that thing i think i only did the practice test like 5 times maybe?? <br>
                maybe im just built different.<br>
                <h6>what do i even talk about idk what to write here why did i make this a separate page</h6>
                <h3>uh music i guess?</h3>
                for a long time i didnt really listen to music? i mean like i guess i *liked* some songs here and there but if i was going to put music on while doing something it was probably just whatever game i was playing at the time's soundtrack<br>
                in 8th grade i played a roblox game who's soundtrack just so happened to be. like. actual music. which was quite unfortunate because that music just so happend to be breakcore (or technically not breakcore but like what the people on tiktok and stuff call breakcore) and now im weird<br>
                it was mostly lapfox and femtanyl that i listened to for a while but then i learned what weezer was and oh oh my god oh oh lord oh my god oh oh no oh<br>
                my sister promptly put me in rehab and we went to barnes and noble for funsies and i got 4 cds:<br>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>green day - greatest hits: gods favorite band</li>
                    <li>linkin park - hybrid theory</li>
                    <li>weird al - dare to be stupid</li>
                    <li>earth wind and fire - greatest hits</li>
                </ul>
                oh that and 3 jujutsu kaisen mangas that i ended up never reading because <i>someone</i> spoiled it for me >:(<br>
                i ended up listening to mostly the green day cd for about a month until i listened to hybrid theory and never listened to green day again whoopsies my bad<br>
                i then *legally* downloaded
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>linkin park - meteora</li>
                    <li>venetian snares - the one with the birds on it nobody can pronounce the name of but u know the one im taling abt</li>
                    <li>venetian snares - detrimentalist</li>
                    <li>venetian snares - the chocolate wheelchair album</li>
                    <li>system of a down - toxicity</li>
                    <li>system of a down - system of a down</li>
                </ul>
                gonna listen to that on repeat constantly until i dont like any of it anymore and find a new band to play until i dont like them either<br>
                <br>
                ~~~
                <br>
                <br>
                i think that should probably be enough to put on here for now. i still dont know what to do with this website i mostly just made it for funsies but i linked it to my discord and instagram and i feel guilty for forgetting abt it for so long so i gotta do something
